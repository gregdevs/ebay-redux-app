This app makes use of the ebay find api's;
Available Paths: 
`/` ,   -  by default request's data for 'funco pop marvel';
`/item/{id}` - detail page for specificied item;
`/item/featured/{keywords}` - a little bonus I threw in;

**Ebay API had cors issue, so I had to take some time to create a proxy to get the data**
